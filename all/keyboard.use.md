I you can't [find some character](https://slcr.wsu.edu/help-pages/microsoft-keyboards-us-international/)

# ReMap

Remape keyboard at hardware level
-   pro :
        work the same in all unix env (even consol only, like other tty)
        close to driver behavior
        persitent
see last section for other possibilities

Setps
---
- create a file `##-name.hwdb` in `/etc/udev/hwdb,d/`
- find ID : bus vendor product
```
lsusb
cat /proc/bus/input/devices
```
- The first line is : `evdev` is an event, `b` is bus , `v` is the vendor, `p` is the product.
Be careful to use Maj for hex numbers 
```
evdev:input:b0003v046Ap0001*
```
- Find scancodes and keycodes (more details next section)
chose event according to `input/devices` result
```
sudo evtest /dev/input/event6
```
- Add variabeles to modify keyboard behavior
Be careful to keep the space before the variables.
```
 KEYBOARD_KEY_<scancode>=<keycode> 
```
- Make the change effective
```
sudo systemd-hwdb update
sudo udevadm trigger
```

Codes
---
```
Event: time 1589474291.336070, -------------- SYN_REPORT ------------
`Event: time 1589474291.423913, type 4 (EV_MSC), code 4 (MSC_SCAN), value 70035
Event: time 1589474291.423913, type 1 (EV_KEY), code 41 (KEY_GRAVE), value 0
Event: time 1589474291.423913, -------------- SYN_REPORT ------------
Event: time 1589474296.752069, type 4 (EV_MSC), code 4 (MSC_SCAN), value 70064
Event: time 1589474296.752069, type 1 (EV_KEY), code 86 (KEY_102ND), value 1
```
- 41 and 86 are keycodes (corresponding to character     ` and ยง )
- value 70035 and 70064 are scancode (signal sent by the keyboard)


Detailed Fist Note
---

#### Identify keyboard ID
Find the ID of the keyboard with its name
```
lsusb
```
- Find matching ID and isolate the handlers name
- Find product and vendors we will use in the `/etc/udev/hwdb.d/61-Cherry-keyboard.hwdb`
```
cat /proc/bus/input/devices
```

#### Create new hardware map file
For now we don't have the keyboard scancodes nor the keycodes
The first line is : `evdev` is an event, `b` is bus (0003 for a usb keyboard), `v` is the vendor, `p` is the product.
Be careful to keep the space before the variables.
```
evdev:input:b0003v046Ap0001*
 FOO=1
```

#### Check if first line well parsed
```
systemd-hwdb query evdev:input:b0003v046Ap0001*
```

#### Grep if keyboard well detected
Then put that in the hwdb file
```
evdev:input:b0003v046Ap0001*
 FOO=1
```
And run
```
udevadm info /sys/class/input/event6 | grep FOO
```

#### Add keyboard key remap
```
 KEYBOARD_KEY_<scancode>=<keycode> 
```
with the scancode the hexadecemal obtained with showkey
and the keycode an lowcase string corresponding to the key(see key event)
without space arround the = sign
```
evdev:input:b0003v046Ap0001*
 KEYBOARD_KEY_38=leftmeta               #Ins : use windows when get alt
 KEYBOARD_KEY_56=leftalt                #Alt : use leftalt when get <>
 KEYBOARD_KEY_e0=102nd                  #<>  : use <>      when get Ins
```
And `grep KEYBOARD_KEY` to check the keyboard vars

NOTE : the best to obtaine scancodes (and keycodes) is to install and use evtest
here [fist line] scancode=value <> and [seconde line] keycode=code <> (KEY_<>)

#### Check keycodes in virtual console 
Tips: change tty
Shortcut: Ctrl-Alt F1 (and Ctrl-Alt-F7 to go back to xserver)
```
showkey --scancodes	# Hexa nb scancodes = signal kb
showkey --keycodes	# Give the keycode nb mapped on that key
```


#### Verify remapping
```
udevadm info keyboard
```

#### Update and trigger
```
sudo systemd-hwdb update
sudo udevadm trigger
```
