script language used in `.bat` files these are windows automations.

[CAUTION]
.Discouraged use
====
Honestly use it only if there is no any other alternative (and you are forced to)
Evrything with this script language is laborious and prone to error.
list of potential alternatives :

* powershell (generally already install on windows)
* bash ( if you have access to WSL or install git bash)
* python (if you cannot install it, use embeded version)
====

.Code example
[source,bat]
----
echo off
setlocal enabledelayedexpansion
set LF=^


@REM Two empty line above are necessary, !LF! is \n
@REM this is a comment
:: this is an other comment

for /l %%n in (0,1,59) do ( 
    ::use "set /a" to compute numeric value
    SET /A phase = %%n * 6
    :: use ! instead of % to be evaluated at execution and not at parsing (req: setlocal enabledelayedexpansion)
    echo Phase : !phase! degree
    .\..\x64\Release\FTDI-Utility.exe 64 0 !phase! | findstr "\.\.\." 
    call :read
    :: Print a line return
    echo:
    echo:

pause
exit /b

:: Labels works as funtion definitions
:read
set "RES="
@REM FOR /F "delims=" %%i IN (' .\..\x64\Release\FTDI-Utility.exe read') DO set "RES=!RES! !LF! %%i"
FOR /F "delims=" %%i IN (' .\..\x64\Release\FTDI-Utility.exe read') DO set "RES=!RES! - %%i"
@REM set DISP=!RES:-=LF!
@REM echo !DISP! | findstr "="
echo !RES!

@REM (if !RES:0.00=!==!RES! echo "should read again")
@REM 0000000000
@REM 0xffffffff
echo !RES! | find "0000000000" 1>nul
if not errorlevel 1 (
    if not !phase!==0 (
        echo Reading again
        goto read
    )
)
exit /b
----

The code above relies on an external command : `FTDI-utility.exe`
It is calling it in a loop alternatively to write value and read register

* https://ss64.com/nt/findstr.html[`findstr`] is processing string as a kind of a poor `grep`
* https://ss64.com/nt/set.html[`set`]
