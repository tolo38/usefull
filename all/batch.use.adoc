script language used in `.bat` files these are windows automations.

[CAUTION]
.Discouraged use
====
Honestly use it only if there is no any other alternative (and you are forced to)
Evrything with this script language is laborious and prone to error.
list of potential alternatives :

* powershell (generally already install on windows)
* bash ( if you have access to WSL or install git bash)
* python (if you cannot install it, use embeded version)
